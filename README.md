# HackerRank Orchestrate

Starter repository for the **HackerRank Orchestrate** 24-hour hackathon (September 2026).

## Buy or Wait?

Build an AI-powered financial agent that decides whether a user can safely afford a requested expense.

A user may ask: **"Can I afford this laptop?"**

Answering well takes more than the current balance. The agent must account for recurring expenses, pending payments, essential spending, confirmed income, available payment options, and relevant details buried in messages and images.

For every request, the agent decides whether the user should pay in full, pay partially, use installments, wait, or not proceed. The recommendation must be personalized: two users with the same balance can deserve different answers based on their commitments, priorities, payment preferences, and willingness to adjust flexible expenses.

A recommendation is safe only if the user can complete the full payment plan, cover essential expenses, and stay above their preferred minimum balance throughout the forecast period.

Read [`problem_statement.md`](./problem_statement.md) for the full task spec, input/output schema, allowed values, conflict-resolution rules, and submission format.

Only `dataset/requests.csv` requires predictions. Everything else is context. All files link on `user_id` and `request_id`.

Amounts are in the user's `home_currency` — the dataset uses INR, ZAR, IDR, USD, and EUR, and every conversion rate you need is in `exchange_rates.csv`. All dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. Live exchange rates, market data, and banking access are not required.

## What You Need to Build

For every row in `dataset/requests.csv`, produce one row in `output.csv` with:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `request_id` | The request being answered |
| `amount_safe_to_pay` | Largest amount safe to pay on `request_date`, after protecting essentials and the minimum balance |
| `affordability_status` | `affordable_now`, `affordable_with_plan`, `affordable_later`, or `not_affordable` |
| `recommended_payment_method` | `full_payment`, `partial_payment`, `installments`, `wait`, or `not_recommended` |
| `payment_plan` | Chronological `<YYYY-MM-DD>:<amount>` entries joined by `\|`, or `none` |
| `earliest_date_for_full_payment` | Earliest date the full amount is forecast safe as one payment; empty if never within the forecast |
| `spending_changes_needed` | Up to three `stop:<event_id>` / `reduce_to:<event_id>:<amount>` changes joined by `\|`, or `none` |
| `decision_explanation` | Short explanation and the financial facts behind it |

`0 <= amount_safe_to_pay <= requested_amount` must always hold. Installment plans must exactly match a supplied payment option, and only recurring expenses marked flexible may be changed.

---

## Suggested Workflow

1. Inspect `dataset/sample_requests.csv` — 25 requests with completed output columns — to understand the expected format and decision style.
2. Reconstruct each user's financial state from `financial_profiles.csv` and `financial_events.csv`: separate recurring expenses from one-time events, reserve pending transactions, count confirmed salary only on its settlement date, and de-duplicate repeated representations of the same event.
3. Pull in the relevant messages, images, and payment options for the request.
4. Forecast forward and generate a plan that keeps the balance above the minimum at every step.
5. Verify deterministically — bounds, plan feasibility, schedule match, flexible-only spending changes — before writing `output.csv`.
6. Score yourself on the solved samples, then run the full dataset.

You may use any language or runtime. Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript are all reasonable choices.

---

## Requirements

Your solution must:

- be runnable from the terminal
- read the provided files from `dataset/`
- produce a valid `output.csv` with the exact required columns in the exact required order
- include one prediction for every `request_id` in `dataset/requests.csv`
- not use organizer-only files or hardcoded labels
- keep behavior deterministic where possible

If you use API keys or secrets, read them from environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in the repo.

---

## Evaluation

Your `output.csv` will be compared against hidden ground-truth values.

The scoring will consider:

- accuracy of `amount_safe_to_pay`
- correctness of `affordability_status`
- correctness of `recommended_payment_method` and `payment_plan`
- accuracy of `earliest_date_for_full_payment`
- validity of `spending_changes_needed`
- usefulness and consistency of `decision_explanation`
- token usage and estimated cost

### Token Usage And Cost Analysis

Cost is part of the score. Your `code.zip` must include one token-usage file:

```text
evaluation/usage_report.md
```

The report must cover model providers and names, model calls, input and output tokens, total and average tokens per request, estimated total and per-request cost. The reported values must correspond to the final full-dataset run that produced your `output.csv`.

## Chat Transcript Logging

This repo includes an [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) file for AI coding tools. It asks compatible tools to append conversation summaries to a `log.txt` in the repository root — the same directory as `AGENTS.md`:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `<repo root>/log.txt` |
| Windows | `<repo root>\log.txt` |

The path resolves relative to `AGENTS.md`, so it stays correct across clones, renames, and checkouts. `log.txt` is gitignored — upload it as your chat transcript at submission time. Do not paste secrets into the chat.

---

## Submission

Submit the following files as instructed by HackerRank:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `code.zip` | Full runnable solution, prompts/configuration, README, and the required `evaluation/` folder |
| `output.csv` | Predictions for every row in `dataset/requests.csv` |
| `chat_transcript` | The `log.txt` described above, showing how you developed or used the system |

Before submitting, confirm:

- `output.csv` has one row per row in `dataset/requests.csv` (250 rows plus the header).
- `output.csv` has the exact required columns in the exact required order.
- Every `amount_safe_to_pay` satisfies `0 <= amount_safe_to_pay <= requested_amount`.
- Every installment plan matches a supplied payment option, and every spending change targets a flexible recurring expense.
- Your runnable code, setup instructions, and `evaluation/` folder are included in `code.zip`.
